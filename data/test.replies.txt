Dear A.L. Thank you for your feedback. 3 stars is a very low rating, and therefore I understand that you are extremely unhappy.

Thanks lynette! Sorry to hear about your daughter's migraines.  We did a check, multi-user function is very challenging, until we finish developing it you may have changed for a new phone and given the old one to your daughter.

Hi Christopher. The sticky 'active sleep detection' notification during the time of the day/night that you set up for sleep detection. This is a compatibility requirement fro Android Oreo and Pie. It does not alter anything to the sleep detection quality and does not use more battery  power either. This notification cannot be removed. Jenny
Hi Sarah, Glad to know that Migraine Buddy is easy and helpful to you. Could you please contact us at jenny@healint.com to let us know how can we earn the last star? Jenny
Thank you Cindy, that's right! I also get those cases when I am not too sure if I sure record but in case of doubt would like to record as very small or non-painful. Just to be sure, is the removed star due to that? or due to a problem your faced? Francois
Thanks Sarah! Did you face problems? I see that you removed a star, which reduces our average rating.

Hi Dawn,  The app relies on the phone's sensors for sleep detection. You could try placing the phone closer to you when you sleep to get more accurate sleep times. In addition, you can go to "Settings" and scroll to "Sleep Settings" and input your usual sleep time so the app can guess better. Please help us by updating the review if these helped!
Thanks so much Betsy! Glad you are liking the app!

Dear Navanit, Thank you for this feedback. 3/5 is a very low rating. To give you a point of comparison: 3 stars apps are usually apps crashing continuously. Does it represent the experience you faced with Migraine Buddy? (we will develop more when above 4.5 average rating, to be sure that we are doing the basics right.)
Thank you Ellen! How can we improve it to make it a 5 star app for you? Feel free to email me at Jenny@healint.com! Thanks!

Dear Gina, glad to know you find the app helpful! The selection in what doesn't work is based on the meds or reliefs you have tried for that migraine.

Thank you for your kind review, Kylie! You're absolutely right! In fact, a variation of pain intensity is one of the most requested addition. While we try to make that a reality, you can update your pain level in the Notes section of the migraine record, using the time stamp located at the top right-hand corner of the screen. =)

Dear Abby, I just see your comment, and thought "ouch, we need to adjust the interface to make it easier to find".

Dear Nicole, thank you for your review, and happy to see that the app helps you. Sadly it was so much effort to make it work on the thousands of variations of screen size just in vertical mode...

Hi Jo, you can track change in the note section of the migraine record. In the same place you also use the timestamp button on the top right corner to better manage your meds efficiency. Hope this will help you better track your migraines and hope it is enough to grab the missing star :-). Jenny
Thanks for your feedback Laura! Currently we are working on a way to track symptom changes. However, in the meantime you can record this and if your migraine is constant, intermittent etc. in the notes section. 4 stars brings down our average- 5 stars are very helpful in improving the app faster! Thanks a lot :) 
Thanks Angie! 
Hi Prakirti, The first two ideas can be found here: http://goo.gl/cSfIyn we would like to know more about how you would want to track the changes in intensity. After V.8.4, the email export should be working fine- we will look into it for you from our end! Anything else we can do to get 5/5 stars? 5 stars encourages us to keep improving faster!
Thank you for your support. Our goal is to deliver our users a 5 stars service. Feel free to contact me at jenny@healint.com for suggestions that will help us grab this missing star back :-) Jenny
Dear Annemarie, This is great to read that you enjoy migraine buddy!

Thank you Michelle, for the feedback. You can actually add items under many area. click on "Add new" (sadly you can not erase it for now, therefore do not put the name of a family member as a trigger). You can also use the Note area in the summary at the end. Do you have other ideas? maybe can you explain me at francois@healint.com ?  
Thanks Sarah, that feature is most requested here: http://goo.gl/XcIJM7 and we are looking into it. For now, maybe you can try using the notes section? We will keep you updated on this idea!

Thanks lynette! Sorry to hear about your daughter's migraines.

Thank You Daniel! An export function will be available very soon within the app, however,if you will be visiting your doctor soon you send an email to contact@healint.com to ask for a listing of your migraine entries. The app is currently not designed for tablets, however, if you have a sim card, it can work. Take care!
Thank you for your feedack. All the Migraine Buddy data is saved on our server, not on your phone. There is an issue with Samsung devices at the moment so if you have one please contact me at Jenny@healint.com and i will help you fix the problem. Jenny
Hi Vickie, thanks for the review! You can easily print your reports by going to export in the drop down menu and emailing your report to yourself.
Hi Chandra,  Thank you for your suggestion. A medication tracker is definitely one of the ideas that we will look into in the future.

If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us at jenny@healint.com
Hi Cathy! You can still add information about your menstruation. You can add ovulation or menstruation as a trigger in ''Triggers" or add more information in the "Notes" screen. Email me at jenny@healint.com and let me know how I can further assist you and earn the missing stars. Jenny
Thank  you, the fifth star would encourage our team of developers who are working hard to make this free app the perfect tool for migraine sufferers. :-) Jenny
Thank you for your kind review, Kylie! You're absolutely right! In fact, a variation of pain intensity is one of the most requested addition. While we try to make that a reality, you can update your pain level in the Notes section of the migraine record, using the time stamp located at the top right-hand corner of the screen. =)
Dear Bonnie, The new function "Daily trigger" may be of some help here to record daily the main state of the continuous headache. For example create 3 buttons to record daily the presence, absence, intensity of this continuous headache...  Feel free to come and talk about it on our facebook chat: http://m.me/migrainebuddy Jenny

Dear Catherine, can you contact me at Jenny@healint.com? I will solve that with you in no time. If you just updated the app and had many records, it may be that you need to wait 30s for the synchronisation and check of data. with the addition of the weather information we had to rethink how the data is stored on the phone.
Thanks for your review and suggestion Joseph. This is a good idea- are you trying to figure out your triggers? Has your doctor suggested that you record details on migraine free days as well? It would be great to discuss more with you on this. Kindly check your email as well. Wishing you well!
Dear Tina, have you set your phone as the main device for sleep tracking? You will have to swipe down on the "Sleep Records" screen and enable it as the main device. if you are still facing problems or need more help, please reach out to me at jenny@healint.com. I'm sure we can make sleep tracking work for you again ^^
Thanks for your feedback Natasha! Currently we are looking into adding food triggers. :)

It is a function requested by many.  Actually, if you wish you can deactivate the location for migraine buddy, in the android menus. Francois  Healint's co-founder & CEO 
Hi Shannon, you can add this as a manual entry under the 'symptoms' tab and it will appear on subsequent migraine records. Hope this helps! Your 5-star reviews would really help us to improve the functionality of the app for our users. :) - Jenny

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it. As you can see most are started. Actually removing a star does not make us go program faster, rather the opposite as we also manage to do more with more users. (ÀÜ_ÀÜ) Jenny
Thanks for the feedback Kate! Yes, it must be frustrating to have the app asking you if it was a period of sleep... while you were working hard. For your case (shutting down the phone for hours) the auto-detection may not learn that fast yet. You may wait to deactivate it. It should help you, not become a frustration. Keep up! Francois
Hi Krystle, Thanks for your review! You can add more options for each category and customize to your requirements. You can do this by tapping Add New. Your support and 5 stars will help us improve the app much faster. Thanks!

Hi Juliet, thanks for your comment. You can see your sleep pattern over time and if it could be a trigger for your migraine. Since migraines have very specific symptoms, maybe you can record what you think is a headache and show your doctor your entry to determine whether it was a headache or migraine. 
Thank you so much!
Thanks for your review Nicole! We hope that the app can help you in managing your migraines. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the input interface, drop me an email at jenny@healint.com. :) - Jenny

Dear Daniel, the location data is used to provide you with more accurate weather info for your migraines because there are cities so big that weather could differ drastically within the same city at the same time.

Dear Nicole, thank you for your review, and happy to see that the app helps you. Sadly it was so much effort to make it work on the thousands of variations of screen size just in vertical mode...

Louise, yes, we have this request a lot. But for now we were not satisfied with the first solutions we tested. I use the Note sections when I change something compared to usual (different dosage, different type of pain)  Does the removed star means that the application is not helpful enough as it is now?

Dear Patch, 2 stars is a very very very bad rating usually reserved for apps which are not working properly or not doing what was advertised.  Would you like to discuss about it to let me understand what's wrong? You can send me a quick e-mail to initiate the discussion, or maybe chat via our facebook page: http://m.me/migrainebuddy ? Jenny (^_~)
Hey Andrea, could I check with you what you mean by print out summary information? You can export all your migraine records by clicking on the menu icon in the top left corner of the Home Screen and then tapping on "Export". Is that what you're looking for? If not, please let me know at jenny@healint.com so I can better understand your needs =)
Thank you Amy, The fifth star would encourage our team of developers who work hard to make this free app the perfect tool for migraine sufferers. Jenny
Thanks for the feedback Kate! Yes, it must be frustrating to have the app asking you if it was a period of sleep... while you were working hard. For your case (shutting down the phone for hours) the auto-detection may not learn that fast yet. You may wait to deactivate it. It should help you, not become a frustration. Keep up! Francois
Dear Marko, thank you for the feedback. We're looking into how we may sync with other apps/device. The key challenge is really to understand how we should map the information from all these external sources meaningfully into categories or onto the migraines. If you have more thoughts on this, do chat with me here: http://m.me/migrainebuddy =)
Happy to see that you are happy Letty. Today is a bad day for us, we never had so many 4 stars in a day. and I see our rating going down It really feels like we are doing something wrong.

Thank you Cindy, that's right! I also get those cases when I am not too sure if I sure record but in case of doubt would like to record as very small or non-painful. Just to be sure, is the removed star due to that? or due to a problem your faced? Francois

Thank you Gabriela. Feel free to contact me at Jenny@healint.com for any suggestions that would improve the app and help me grab the missing star back. :-) Jenny
Hi Christopher. The sticky 'active sleep detection' notification during the time of the day/night that you set up for sleep detection. This is a compatibility requirement fro Android Oreo and Pie. It does not alter anything to the sleep detection quality and does not use more battery  power either. This notification cannot be removed. Jenny
Hi Steve, were you able to install it? The latest update is version 1671, you can give it a try :) - Jenny
Thank you Faith. You cannot change settings of medications because it would alter the reports where you have already used these medications. On the other hand, you can delete an unused med and create it again immediately with the correct settings. 5-stars would be the ultimate reward for our developers :) Jenny

Thanks for your feedback Natasha! Currently we are looking into adding food triggers. :)
Dear Nigel, "my trigger" section was designed to help with identifying triggers you didn't realise was a problem. So you should use it as your food diary and create items corresponding to your food.

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it.

Dear Corinne, this request may take time, I just checked and we have 59 other improvements with more votes in the forum. (leave feedback button in the app, then suggestion). for now, may I suggest you to write "@Stomach" in the Note section of your migraines with stomach pain?  It will be visible on your exports for your doctors.  
Jill, good to hear that you are satisfied.  It makes me sad to see that you removed a start though, it is reduces the average rating visible to potential users. We want to give more functions in the app, but if the present version is not working perfectly we need to polish the existing functions! I am here to help if anything.  Jenny@healint.com

Hi Christopher. The sticky 'active sleep detection' notification during the time of the day/night that you set up for sleep detection. This is a compatibility requirement fro Android Oreo and Pie.

Dear Abby, I just see your comment, and thought "ouch, we need to adjust the interface to make it easier to find".

If you specify you headache as headache, this will allow you to analyse those together or separately from the migraines. Jenny@healint.com

Dear Adrienne, actually you can create a migraine at a past date. This is very easy: you just create a "new" migraine and chose manually a start date and end date in the past with the buttons on the right ("input time").  I hope this solved the problem.

Dear Navanit, Thank you for this feedback. 3/5 is a very low rating. To give you a point of comparison: 3 stars apps are usually apps crashing continuously.

Hi Christopher. The sticky 'active sleep detection' notification during the time of the day/night that you set up for sleep detection. This is a compatibility requirement fro Android Oreo and Pie.

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it.

Dear Nigel, "my trigger" section was designed to help with identifying triggers you didn't realise was a problem. So you should use it as your food diary and create items corresponding to your food. After 15+ days of data, you can use the "Catch" feature to see if a trigger is likely or unlikely to have caused migraines!
Hi Scarlett, not sure i understand this comment? Jenny
Hi Jo, you can track change in the note section of the migraine record. In the same place you also use the timestamp button on the top right corner to better manage your meds efficiency. Hope this will help you better track your migraines and hope it is enough to grab the missing star :-). Jenny
Thank you so much!
Thank you Lorin, we are working on the best way to implemant a change during attach tracker. In the meantime you can use the note section of the migraine record to report any changes, and use the timestamp button on the top right corner of this section . You also have a stopwatch button on your medicine page to track when you have taken a medicine.
Hi Marianne,  The team is currently prototyping how to track fluctuating pain intensity. Meanwhile, you can use the pain intensity section to log the max pain intensity and the notes section to log the changes in pain intensity. There's a timestamp icon on the top right corner of the notes section to help you make notes quickly. Hope this helps!

I see that you are happy with migraine-buddy. This is sad though to see that you removed a star. I feels like a punishment as this is lowering the average rating visible to every new potential users.

Hi Lydia,  You can track pain variation by using the "Notes" section of your migraine record. There is a timestamp function on the top right hand corner of the notes section to allow you to quickly log the current time and you can write about your pain level at that point in time. Please help us by updating this review if this solves your need!
Dear Karen, It's great to hear that the start up issue has been resolved for you. We are looking to release a new version soon so please look forward to the update and help us update your review if it is faster for you. :-) As for the different pain levels, have you tried logging it inside the notes section of the migraines?  Cheers Jenny
Hi Shannon, you can add this as a manual entry under the 'symptoms' tab and it will appear on subsequent migraine records. Hope this helps! Your 5-star reviews would really help us to improve the functionality of the app for our users. :) - Jenny
Thanks for the feedback Kate! Yes, it must be frustrating to have the app asking you if it was a period of sleep... while you were working hard. For your case (shutting down the phone for hours) the auto-detection may not learn that fast yet. You may wait to deactivate it. It should help you, not become a frustration. Keep up! Francois

Feel free to contact me at Jenny@healint.com for assistance or suggestion that would help me grab the missing star back :-) Jenny
Thank you for your kind review, Kylie! You're absolutely right! In fact, a variation of pain intensity is one of the most requested addition.

Dear Carly, Thank you, it makes sense! Usually we can always say "no symptom" or "no aura", which is different from skipping. Let's find a simple way to add that. Also, is there a problem with the app which is making you remove a star? We want to have everything done perfectly before adding new functions. Francois

Dear Tobias, when you add a new medication, you can specify the dosage e.g. 50mg. In which case +/- would mean +/- 50mg. Or you could leave the dosage empty and it would mean +/- 1 pill. We made this flexible for people to record in a way that is easiest for them ^^ If this helps, do help me by updating this review. Thank you!
Thank you for your support. Our goal is to deliver our users a 5 stars service. Feel free to contact me at jenny@healint.com for suggestions that will help us grab this missing star back :-) Jenny

Dear Marko, thank you for the feedback. We're looking into how we may sync with other apps/device. The key challenge is really to understand how we should map the information from all these external sources meaningfully into categories or onto the migraines. If you have more thoughts on this, do chat with me here: http://m.me/migrainebuddy =)
Thanks for the feedback Kate! Yes, it must be frustrating to have the app asking you if it was a period of sleep... while you were working hard. For your case (shutting down the phone for hours) the auto-detection may not learn that fast yet. You may wait to deactivate it. It should help you, not become a frustration. Keep up! Francois

Hi Benoit, While multiple users on one account would be convenient to help manage kids' profile, there are privacy concerns over healthcare data which could have legal implications. Please let us know what else we can do to get the missing star back. It means a lot to the future development of the app. You can reach us at jenny@healint.com
Hi there, thanks for taking the time to leave a review :) Has the app helped you in detecting triggers in your migraines? If you have feedback on how we can improve, you can contact me at jenny@healint.com - Jenny

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it. As you can see most are started. Actually removing a star does not make us go program faster, rather the opposite as we also manage to do more with more users. (ÀÜ_ÀÜ) Jenny

Dear Sarah, no worry, this is actually meant to make it easier for doctors. All migraines vary a lot, the pain level, the position etc... having only one key value makes it easy for your doctor to compare seizures in the lists. But you should use the notes too to record more details for you! Any disfunction made you remove a star? Jenny@healint.com
Thank you Jennifer, you are right. I should have added the Menopause function, my apologies for that. I put it in the list for the next version. (it will come in 1 or 2 months) For the weather, we are working on it, actually it will come fast! Wishing you as few migraines as possible, Francois
Hi Bezalel, you may add aura position in the notes of the summary section and it will appear in your export listing :) if you need further assistance with this, I will be glad to help you. Email me at jenny@healint.com. Thanks so much for your review! - Jenny

Hi Zoe, yes, this would be very useful for some of us, this is actually under design and testing, to make it very easy to use. 4 stars is a big punishment for us (ÀÜ_ÀÜ) because it pulls down the rating, but despite that we will continue to work as hard as in 2014!

Hi Terina, thanks very much! You actually have an area for comments in the summary screen of the migraine, just under the weather field, you can even put a time stamp for each line (button top right) and it will print with the export. try it and tell me. your support and 5 stars will help us improve the app much faster! Thank you! jenny@healint.com
Hi Simone,  Great to know you like the app ^^ You can track the changes in the pain intensity by using the notes section of the migraine. It has a time stamp option which helps you log the pain level at a given time. The team is currently working on a prototype to see how we can help users track the changes in pain intensity in a more elegant way.
Thank you Alli. The fifth stars would encourage our developers who work hard to make this free app the perfect  tool for migraine sufferers. Jenny

Thank you Pearl for this feedback! But based on your note it seems that there is something in the app that you don't like, is it right? :-) If yes, could you please contact me at jenny@healint.com? We could discuss deeper about it and find a solution! Otherwise, if everything is fine, you can also update your note! :-) Thank a lot!
Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it. As you can see most are started. Actually removing a star does not make us go program faster, rather the opposite as we also manage to do more with more users. (ÀÜ_ÀÜ) Jenny
Thanks Malini! Can you write to us at contact@healint.com to tell us which period tracker you use? We are looking into syncing Migraine Buddy with other apps. And yes, you are right, Periods can have a tricky relation with migraines. Did you record yourself as a woman in the app? It will then ask you questions about your periods too.
Thank you so much for the lovely review Kristin!

Dear Catherine, can you contact me at Jenny@healint.com? I will solve that with you in no time.

Hi Stephanie, yes you are right, in order to match Android 9 new settings the only way is to keep the sleep tracking notification on all night. It desappears in the morning so.

Thank you so much for your lovely review Donna!
Dear Carly, Thank you, it makes sense! Usually we can always say "no symptom" or "no aura", which is different from skipping. Let's find a simple way to add that. Also, is there a problem with the app which is making you remove a star? We want to have everything done perfectly before adding new functions. Francois
Thanks Melissa!
Hi there, I'm glad you find the app useful! ^^ Can you share with me more at jenny@healint.com how adding notes in the Daily Tracker will be useful for you? I would love to hear your opinion. Thank you!
Hi Alecia, you can identify possible food triggers using "My Triggers" (bottom left icon on the home screen). Add and track all the different types of food you eat daily. When you have a migraine, your  recently eaten food will be highlighted when you are asked to choose your triggers. Do help us update your review if this solves your problem!
Thanks so much for the awesome review Shelly :)

Hi Simone,  Great to know you like the app ^^ You can track the changes in the pain intensity by using the notes section of the migraine. It has a time stamp option which helps you log the pain level at a given time.

Thanks so much Michelle! How can we make it a 5 star app for you?

Dear Sarah, no worry, this is actually meant to make it easier for doctors. All migraines vary a lot, the pain level, the position etc... having only one key value makes it easy for your doctor to compare seizures in the lists. But you should use the notes too to record more details for you! Any disfunction made you remove a star? Jenny@healint.com

Dear Gina, glad to know you find the app helpful! The selection in what doesn't work is based on the meds or reliefs you have tried for that migraine.

Dear Tonya, the good news is that you can change to Fahrenheit, just go into the Settings and change to "imperial" measures. For the location this depends from your phone's GPS but you can also adjust manually. Feel free to contact me at Jenny@healint.com if needing more help. It would be great to give back the removed star too ;)
Thank you Richard. Anything I can do to grab the fifth star? :-) Jenny

Thank you for your kind review, Kylie! You're absolutely right! In fact, a variation of pain intensity is one of the most requested addition. While we try to make that a reality, you can update your pain level in the Notes section of the migraine record, using the time stamp located at the top right-hand corner of the screen. =)
Dear Christine, We considered this possibility but many Android phones do have occasional bugs when using the SD cards. It can create a security problem or a loss of data. Those data are very important for you, and unique. We will only do it as soon as we confirm that Android became reliable on that! Francois
Thanks Malini! Can you write to us at contact@healint.com to tell us which period tracker you use? We are looking into syncing Migraine Buddy with other apps. And yes, you are right, Periods can have a tricky relation with migraines. Did you record yourself as a woman in the app? It will then ask you questions about your periods too.

Hi Dawn,  The app relies on the phone's sensors for sleep detection. You could try placing the phone closer to you when you sleep to get more accurate sleep times. In addition, you can go to "Settings" and scroll to "Sleep Settings" and input your usual sleep time so the app can guess better. Please help us by updating the review if these helped!

Hi Glen,  Great to know that Migraine Buddy has helped you identify a trigger ^^ How can we improve for a 5 star review? The missing star really means a lot to us and the development of new features for the app. Please let us know at jenny@healint.com
Hi there, I'm glad you find the app helpful! ^^ I noticed you gave us 4 stars which usually indicate minor problems with the app. =( Did you encounter a problem with the app? Please let us know what we can do to earn the missing star! I would love to hear from you at jenny@healint.com. Thank you!
Thank you for your feedback. Please contact me directly at Jenny@healint.com if you need assistance with the app. This might help me grab the missing star! :-) Jenny
Dear Kira, thank you for your suggestion. To track blood pressure, you could add it in Triggers screen: less than 120 BP, 120-139 BP, 140-159 BP and more than 160 BP. This helps you see if your BP level has any relationship with your migraines. If this helps, do help us by updating your review. Do email me at jenny@healint.com if you need more help
Thank you. How can i help you to grab back the missing star? :-) Jenny
Thanks for your feedback Natasha! Currently we are looking into adding food triggers. :)
Dear Joy, thank you for your feedback! Could you elaborate more on what you mean a better file extract option? Currently, it exports as a html file with your migraine record in table format. Are you hoping for an excel download or something else? Please let me know more at jenny@healint.com.
Hi Phil, thanks for your review! Glad to hear the app can help you track. Can you email me at jenny@healint.com with your location? In the meantime, your support and 5 stars helps us to improve the app even further! Thanks :)

Hi Steve, thanks for your review :) once you have used it for some time, do update your review if it is worthy of 5 stars! If not, you can email your suggestions to jenny@healint.com - Jenny
Hi Stephanie, yes you are right, in order to match Android 9 new settings the only way is to keep the sleep tracking notification on all night. It desappears in the morning so. This is unfortunately the only way to have the sleep tracker work with Android 9, not something we added intentionaly. Hope this clarifies enough to get the missing star?:-)
Great to hear the app is helping Lauren! I see we missed one star in the rating, is there anyway we can improve to make it a 5 star one for you? I'd love to hear from you- feel free to email me at jenny@healint.com. Thanks :)

Thanks Jo! We see we were one star short of 5 stars- were you disappointed with the app in anyway? How can we earn the missing one star? It would be great to hear from you! you can email me at jenny@healint.com. Thank you :)
Dear JoAnna,  Yes you can do that! You could track the food groups in "My Triggers" section. It is in the bottom left corner of the home screen. It functions as a daily tracker of the things that happen to you. You can add new items to track. Once you tracked it in "My Triggers", food you've eaten before the onset of a migraine will be highlighted
