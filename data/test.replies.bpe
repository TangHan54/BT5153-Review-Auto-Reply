Dear Jo@@ An@@ na, Yes you can do that! You could track the food groups in "My Triggers" section. It is in the bottom left corner of the home screen. It functions as a daily tracker of the things that happen to you. You can add new items to track. Once you tracked it in "My Tr@@ ig@@ g@@ er@@ s@@ ", food you've eaten before the onset of a migraine will be highlighted

Dear Navanit, Thank you for this feedback. 3/5 is a very low rating. To give you a point of comparison: 3 stars apps are usually apps crashing continuously. Does it represent the experience you faced with Migraine Buddy? (we will develop more when above 4.5 average rating, to be sure that we are doing the basics right.)
Thank you Ell@@ en! How can we improve it to make it a 5 star app for you? Feel free to email me at Jenny@healint.co@@ m! Thanks!

Dear G@@ ina, glad to know you find the app helpful! The selection in what doesn't work is based on the meds or reliefs you have tried for that migraine.

Louise, yes, we have this request a lot. But for now we were not satisfied with the first solutions we tested. I use the Note sections when I change something compared to usual (@@ different dos@@ age, different type of pain@@ ) Does the removed star means that the application is not helpful enough as it is now?

Thank you for your kind review, Ky@@ lie! You're absolutely right! In fact, a variation of pain intensity is one of the most requested additi@@ on. While we try to make that a real@@ ity, you can update your pain level in the Notes section of the migraine record, using the time stamp located at the top right-hand corner of the screen. =)
Dear Bonni@@ e, The new function "Daily trigger@@ " may be of some help here to record daily the main st@@ ate of the continuous headache. For example create 3 buttons to record daily the pres@@ enc@@ e, ab@@ s@@ enc@@ e, intensity of this continuous headache... Feel free to come and talk about it on our facebook chat: http://m.me/migrainebuddy Jenny

Thanks for your review and suggestion Joseph@@ . This is a good idea- are you trying to figure out your triggers? Has your doctor suggested that you record details on migraine free days as well@@ ? It would be great to discuss more with you on this. Kindly check your email as well. Wishing you well!

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it. As you can see most are started. Actually removing a star does not make us go program faster, rather the opposite as we also manage to do more with more users. (ÀÜ_ÀÜ) Jenny
Thanks for the feedback Kate! Yes, it must be frustrating to have the app asking you if it was a period of sleep@@ ... while you were working hard. For your case (@@ shutting down the phone for hour@@ s) the auto-@@ detection may not learn that fast yet. You may wait to deactivate it. It should help you, not become a frustration. Keep up!

Hi Juli@@ et, thanks for your comment. You can see your sleep pattern over time and if it could be a trigger for your migraine.

Hi Christop@@ her. The st@@ icky '@@ active sleep det@@ ecti@@ on@@ ' notification during the time of the day/@@ night that you set up for sleep detection. This is a compati@@ bility requirement fr@@ o Android O@@ re@@ o and Pi@@ e. It does not alt@@ er anything to the sleep detection quality and does not use more battery power either. This notification cannot be remov@@ ed. Jenny
Hi Steve, were you able to install it? The latest update is version 1671, you can give it a try :) - Jenny
Thank you Fai@@ th. You cannot change settings of medications because it would alt@@ er the reports where you have already used these medications. On the other hand, you can delete an un@@ used med and create it again immediately with the correct settings. 5-stars would be the ul@@ tim@@ ate reward for our developers :) Jenny

Dear Navanit, Thank you for this feedback. 3/5 is a very low rating. To give you a point of comparison: 3 stars apps are usually apps crashing continuously.

Hi Mari@@ anne, The team is currently prototyping how to track fluctu@@ ating pain intensity.

I see that you are happy with migraine-buddy. This is sad though to see that you removed a star. I feels like a pun@@ ish@@ ment as this is lowering the average rating visible to every new potential users. It slows down the new develop@@ ment. But I will not ab@@ an@@ don@@ ! If you can contact me to tell what made you reduce our rating? Jenny@healint.com

Hi Lydi@@ a, You can track pain variation by using the "Notes" section of your migraine record. There is a timestamp function on the top right hand corner of the notes section to allow you to quickly log the current time and you can write about your pain level at that point in time. Please help us by updating this review if this solves your need!
Dear Karen, It's great to hear that the start up issue has been resolved for you. We are looking to release a new version soon so please look forward to the update and help us update your review if it is faster for you. :-) As for the different pain levels, have you tried logging it inside the notes section of the migraines? Cheers Jenny

Dear Nicki, I fully understand, I also wished it could already do all that. You can vote for ideas similar to yours on our forum: goo.gl/IGRBQW and add your comments in it.

Dear Sarah, no worry, this is actually meant to make it easier for doctors.

Thank you Jennifer, you are r@@ ight. I should have added the Men@@ op@@ a@@ use function, my apologies for that. I put it in the list for the next version.

Louise, yes, we have this request a lot. But for now we were not satisfied with the first solutions we tested.

Francois
Thank you for your kind words Mart@@ in. The fifth star would encourage our hard-working developers who make this free app the perfect tool for migraine sufferers. Jenny :-)

Dear Sarah, no worry, this is actually meant to make it easier for doctors. All migraines vary a lot, the pain level, the position etc... having only one key value makes it easy for your doctor to compare seiz@@ ures in the list@@ s. But you should use the notes too to record more details for you! Any dis@@ function made you remove a star? Jenny@healint.com

Dear G@@ ina, glad to know you find the app helpful! The selection in what doesn't work is based on the meds or reliefs you have tried for that migraine.
